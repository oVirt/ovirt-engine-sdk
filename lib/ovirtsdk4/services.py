        Adds a new floating disk.
        There are three types of disks that can be added - disk image, direct LUN and Managed Block disk.
        https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Cinder[Cinder] integration has been replaced by Managed Block Storage.
        *Adding a new image disk:*
        When creating a new floating image <<types/disk,Disk>>, the API requires the `storage_domain`, `provisioned_size`
        and `format` attributes.
        Note that block storage domains (i.e., storage domains with the <<types/storage_type, storage type>> of iSCSI or
        FCP) don't support the combination of the raw `format` with `sparse=true`, so `sparse=false` must be stated
        explicitly.
        To create a new floating image disk with specified `provisioned_size`, `format` and `name` on a storage domain
        with an id `123`, send a request as follows:
        [source]
        ----
        POST /ovirt-engine/api/disks
        ----
        With a request body as follows:

        <disk>
          <storage_domains>
            <storage_domain id="123"/>

          <name>mydisk</name>
          <provisioned_size>1048576</provisioned_size>
          <format>cow</format>
        </disk>
        ----
        *Adding a new direct LUN disk:*
        When adding a new floating direct LUN via the API, there are two flavors that can be used:
        . With a `host` element - in this case, the host is used for sanity checks (e.g., that the LUN is visible) and
        to retrieve basic information about the LUN (e.g., size and serial).
        . Without a `host` element - in this case, the operation is a database-only operation, and the storage is never
        accessed.
        To create a new floating direct LUN disk with a `host` element with an id `123`, specified `alias`, `type` and
        `logical_unit` with an id `456` (that has the attributes `address`, `port` and `target`),
        send a request as follows:
        [source]
        ----
        POST /ovirt-engine/api/disks
        ----
        With a request body as follows:
        [source,xml]

          </lun_storage>
        </disk>
        ----
        To create a new floating direct LUN disk without using a host, remove the `host` element.
        *Adding a new Cinder disk:*
        Cinder integration has been replaced by Managed Block Storage.
        //TODO: Add an example for adding an MBS disk
        *Adding a floating disks in order to upload disk snapshots:*
        Since version 4.2 of the engine it is possible to upload disks with
        snapshots. This request should be used to create the base image of the
        images chain (The consecutive disk snapshots (images), should be created
        using `disk-attachments` element when creating a snapshot).
        The disk has to be created with the same disk identifier and image identifier
        of the uploaded image. I.e. the identifiers should be saved as part of the
        backup process. The image identifier can be also fetched using the
        `qemu-img info` command. For example, if the disk image is stored into
        a file named `b7a4c6c5-443b-47c5-967f-6abc79675e8b/myimage.img`:

        The order of the returned list of events is always garanteed. If the `sortby` clause is included in the
        `search` parameter, then the events will be ordered according to that clause. If the `sortby` clause isn't
        included, then the events will be sorted by the numeric value of the `id` attribute, starting with the
        highest value. This, combined with the `max` parameter, simplifies obtaining the most recent event:

        GET /ovirt-engine/api/events?max=1

        This method supports the following parameters:

        `from_`:: Indicates the event index after which events should be returned. The indexes of events are
        strictly increasing, so when this parameter is used only the events with greater indexes
        will be returned. For example, the following request will return only the events
        with indexes greater than `123`:
        [source]
        ----
        GET /ovirt-engine/api/events?from=123
        ----
        This parameter is optional, and if not specified then the first event returned will be most recently
        generated.

        `max`:: Sets the maximum number of events to return. If not specified all the events are returned.

        `search`:: The events service provides search queries similar to other resource services.
        We can search by providing specific severity.

        A virtualization environment generates a large amount of events after
        a period of time. However, the API only displays a default number of
        events for one search query. To display more than the default, the API
        separates results into pages with the page command in a search query.
        The following search query tells the API to paginate results using a
        page value in combination with the sortby clause:
        [source]
        ----
        sortby time asc page 1

        Below example paginates event resources. The URL-encoded request is:
        [source]
        ----
        GET /ovirt-engine/api/events?search=sortby%20time%20asc%20page%201
        ----
        Increase the page value to view the next page of results.

        ----
        GET /ovirt-engine/api/events?search=sortby%20time%20asc%20page%202
        ----

        `case_sensitive`:: Indicates if the search performed using the `search` parameter should be performed taking case into
        account. The default value is `true`, which means that case is taken into account. If you want to search
        ignoring case set it to `false`.

        `follow`:: Indicates which inner links should be _followed_. The objects referenced by these links will be fetched as part
        of the current request. See <<documents/003_common_concepts/follow, here>> for details.

        The host is created based on the attributes of the `host` parameter. The `name`, `address`, and `root_password`

        For example, to add a host, send the following request:
        [source]
        ----
        POST /ovirt-engine/api/hosts

        IMPORTANT: Since version 4.1.2 of the engine, when a host is newly added, the host's firewall
        definitions are overridden by default.
        To add a hosted engine host, use the optional `deploy_hosted_engine` parameter:
        [source]
        ----
        POST /ovirt-engine/api/hosts?deploy_hosted_engine=true

        If the cluster has a default external network provider that is supported for automatic deployment,
        the external network provider is deployed when adding the host.
        Only external network providers for OVN are supported for the automatic deployment.
        To deploy an external network provider other than the one defined in the clusters, overwrite the external
        network provider when adding hosts, by sending the following request:
        [source]
        ----
        POST /ovirt-engine/api/hosts

        `search`:: A query string used to restrict the returned hosts.

        `case_sensitive`:: Indicates if the search performed using the `search` parameter should be performed taking case into
        account. The default value is `true`, which means that case is taken into account. If you want to search
        ignoring case set it to `false`.

        `filter`:: Indicates if the results should be filtered according to the permissions of the user.

        `all_content`:: Indicates if all of the attributes of the hosts should be included in the response.
        By default the following host attributes are excluded:
        - `hosted_engine`
        For example, to retrieve the complete representation of the hosts:
        ....
        GET /ovirt-engine/api/hosts?all_content=true
        ....
        NOTE: These attributes are not included by default because retrieving them impacts performance. They are
        seldom used and require additional queries to the database. Use this parameter with caution and only when
        specifically required.

        `migration_target_of`:: Accepts a comma-separated list of virtual machine IDs and returns the hosts
        that these virtual machines can be migrated to.
        For example, to retrieve the list of hosts to which the virtual machine with ID 123 and
        the virtual machine with ID 456 can be migrated to, send the following request:
        ....
        GET /ovirt-engine/api/hosts?migration_target_of=123,456
        ....

        `check_vms_in_affinity_closure`:: This parameter can be used with `migration_target_of`
        to get valid migration targets for the listed virtual machines
        and all other virtual machines that are in positive enforcing
        affinity with the listed virtual machines.
        This is useful in case the virtual machines will be migrated
        together with others in positive affinity groups.
        The default value is `false`.
        ....
        GET /ovirt-engine/api/hosts?migration_target_of=123,456&check_vms_in_affinity_closure=true
        ....

        `follow`:: Indicates which inner links should be _followed_. The objects referenced by these links will be fetched as part
        of the current request. See <<documents/003_common_concepts/follow, here>> for details.

        `headers`:: Additional HTTP headers.

class ImageTransferService(Service):
    """
    This service provides a mechanism to control an image transfer. The client will have
    to create a transfer by using <<services/image_transfers/methods/add, add>>
    of the <<services/image_transfers>> service, stating the image to transfer
    data to/from.
    After doing that, the transfer is managed by this service.
    *Using oVirt's Python's SDK:*
    Uploading a `disk` with id `123` (on a random host in the data center):
    [source,python]
    ----
    transfers_service = system_service.image_transfers_service()
    transfer = transfers_service.add(
       types.ImageTransfer(
          disk=types.Disk(
             id='123'
          )
       )
    )
    ----
    Uploading a `disk` with id `123` on `host` id `456`:
    [source,python]
    ----
    transfers_service = system_service.image_transfers_service()
    transfer = transfers_service.add(
       types.ImageTransfer(
          disk=types.Disk(
             id='123'
          ),
          host=types.Host(
             id='456'
         )
       )
    )
    ----
    If the user wishes to download a disk rather than upload, he/she should specify
    `download` as the <<types/image_transfer_direction, direction>> attribute of the transfer.
    This will grant a read permission from the image, instead of a write permission.
    E.g:
    [source,python]
    ----
    transfers_service = system_service.image_transfers_service()
    transfer = transfers_service.add(
       types.ImageTransfer(
          disk=types.Disk(
             id='123'
          ),
          direction=types.ImageTransferDirection.DOWNLOAD
       )
    )
    ----
    Transfers have phases, which govern the flow of the upload/download.
    A client implementing such a flow should poll/check the transfer's phase and
    act accordingly. All the possible phases can be found in
    <<types/image_transfer_phase, ImageTransferPhase>>.
    After adding a new transfer, its phase will be <<types/image_transfer_phase, initializing>>.
    The client will have to poll on the transfer's phase until it changes.
    When the phase becomes <<types/image_transfer_phase, transferring>>,
    the session is ready to start the transfer.
    For example:
    [source,python]
    ----
    transfer_service = transfers_service.image_transfer_service(transfer.id)
    while transfer.phase == types.ImageTransferPhase.INITIALIZING:
       time.sleep(3)
       transfer = transfer_service.get()
    ----
    At that stage, if the transfer's phase is <<types/image_transfer_phase, paused_system>>, then the session was
    not successfully established. One possible reason for that is that the ovirt-imageio-daemon is not running
    in the host that was selected for transfer.
    The transfer can be resumed by calling <<services/image_transfer/methods/resume, resume>>
    of the service that manages it.
    If the session was successfully established - the returned transfer entity will
    contain the <<types/image_transfer, transfer_url>> and <<types/image_transfer, proxy_url>> attributes,
    which the client needs to use in order to transfer the required data. The client can choose whatever
    technique and tool for sending the HTTPS request with the image's data.
    - `transfer_url` is the address of an imageio server running on one of the hypervisors.
    - `proxy_url` is the address of an imageio proxy server that can be used if
      you cannot access transfer_url.
    To transfer the image, it is recommended to use the imageio client python library.
    [source,python]
    ----
    from ovirt_imageio import client
    # Upload qcow2 image to virtual disk:
    client.upload("disk.qcow2", transfer.transfer_url)
    # Download virtual disk to qcow2 image:
    client.download(transfer.transfer_url, "disk.qcow2")
    ----
    You can also upload and download using imageio REST API. For more info
    on this, see imageio API documentation:
        http://ovirt.github.io/ovirt-imageio/images.html
    When finishing the transfer, the user should call
    <<services/image_transfer/methods/finalize, finalize>>. This will make the
    final adjustments and verifications for finishing the transfer process.
    For example:
    [source,python]
    ----
    transfer_service.finalize()
    ----
    In case of an error, the transfer's phase will be changed to
    <<types/image_transfer_phase, finished_failure>>, and
    the disk's status will be changed to `Illegal`. Otherwise it will be changed to
    <<types/image_transfer_phase, finished_success>>, and the disk will be ready
    to be used. In both cases, the transfer entity will be removed shortly after.
    *Using HTTP and cURL calls:*
    - For upload, create a new disk first:
    * Specify 'initial_size' and 'provisioned_size' in bytes.
    * 'initial_size' must be bigger or the same as the size of the uploaded data.

      or, use 'proxy_url' for transferring from/to ovirt-imageio-proxy.
      Note: using the proxy would mitigate scenarios where there's no direct connectivity
      to the daemon machine, e.g. vdsm machines are on a different network than the engine.

    Represents a readonly network filters sub-collection.
    The network filter enables to filter packets send to/from the VM's nic according to defined rules.
    For more information please refer to <<services/network_filter,NetworkFilter>> service documentation
    Network filters are supported in different versions, starting from version 3.0.
    A network filter is defined for each vnic profile.
    A vnic profile is defined for a specific network.
    A network can be assigned to several different clusters. In the future, each network will be defined in
    cluster level.
    Currently, each network is being defined at data center level. Potential network filters for each network
    are determined by the network's data center compatibility version V.
    V must be >= the network filter version in order to configure this network filter for a specific network.
    Please note, that if a network is assigned to cluster with a version supporting a network filter, the filter
    may not be available due to the data center version being smaller then the network filter's version.
    Example of listing all of the supported network filters for a specific cluster:

        request body. Note that disks which are not specified in `disk_attachments` element will not be a
        part of the snapshot. If an empty `disk_attachments` element is passed, the snapshot will include
        only the virtual machine configuration. If no `disk_attachments` element is passed, then all
        the disks will be included in the snapshot.
        For each disk, `image_id` element can be specified for setting the new active image id.
        This is used in order to restore a chain of images from backup. I.e. when restoring
        a disk with snapshots, the relevant `image_id` should be specified for each snapshot
        (so the identifiers of the disk snapshots are identical to the backup).

        ====
        When a snapshot is created the default value for the <<types/snapshot/attributes/persist_memorystate,
        persist_memorystate>> attribute is `true`. That means that the content of the memory of the virtual
        machine will be included in the snapshot, and it also means that the virtual machine will be paused
        for a longer time. That can negatively affect applications that are very sensitive to timing (NTP
        servers, for example). In those cases make sure that you set the attribute to `false`:

        ====
        There is NO backward compatibility and no guarantee about the names or values of the options. Options may be
        removed and their meaning can be changed at any point.
        We strongly discourage the use of this service for applications other than the ones that are released
        simultaneously with the engine. Usage by other applications is not supported. Therefore there will be no
        documentation listing accessible configuration options.
        ====


        This method supports the following parameters:

        `version`:: Optional version parameter that specifies that only particular version of the configuration option
        should be returned.
        If this parameter isn't used then all the versions will be returned.

        virtual machine has a disk with the identifier `456`, and, for that disk, you want to change the name to `mydisk`
        the format to <<types/disk_format, _Copy On Write_>> and make it <<types/disk, sparse>>, send a request body like

        for the new template, and the `base_template` and `version_name` attributes for the new template version. The
        `base_template` and `version_name` attributes must be specified within a `version` section enclosed in the
        `template` section. Identify the virtual machine with the `id` or `name` attributes.

        Updates the information about this CDROM device.
        It allows to change or eject the disk by changing the value of the `file` attribute.
        For example, to insert or change the disk send a request like this:

        ----
        PUT /ovirt-engine/api/vms/123/cdroms/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000

        The value of the `id` attribute, `mycd.iso` in this example, should correspond to a file available in an

        after the next boot, but they don't have any effect on the currently running virtual machine. If you want
        to change the disk that is visible to the current running virtual machine, add the `current=true` parameter.
        For example, to eject the current disk send a request like this:

        ----
        PUT /ovirt-engine/api/vms/123/cdroms/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000?current=true

        When creating a virtual machine from a template or from a snapshot it is usually useful to explicitly indicate
        in what storage domain to create the disks for the virtual machine. If the virtual machine is created from
        a template then this is achieved passing a set of `disk_attachment` elements that indicate the mapping:

        Returns the list of virtual machines of the system.
        The order of the returned list of virtual machines is guaranteed only if the `sortby` clause is included
        in the `search` parameter.


        This method supports the following parameters:

        `search`:: A query string used to restrict the returned virtual machines.

        `max`:: The maximum number of results to return.

        `case_sensitive`:: Indicates if the search performed using the `search` parameter should be performed taking case into
        account. The default value is `true`, which means that case is taken into account. If you want to search
        ignoring case set it to `false`.

        `filter`:: Indicates if the results should be filtered according to the permissions of the user.

        `all_content`:: Indicates if all the attributes of the virtual machines should be included in the response.
        By default the following attributes are excluded:
        - `console`
        - `initialization.configuration.data` - The OVF document describing the virtual machine.
        - `rng_source`
        - `soundcard`
        - `virtio_scsi`
        For example, to retrieve the complete representation of the virtual machines send a request like this:
        ....
        GET /ovirt-engine/api/vms?all_content=true
        ....
        NOTE: The reason for not including these attributes is performance: they are seldom used and they require
        additional queries to the database. So try to use the this parameter only when it is really needed.

        `ovf_as_ova`:: Indicates if the results should expose the OVF as it appears in OVA files of that VM. The OVF document
        describing the virtual machine. This parameter will work only when all_content=True is set.
        The OVF will be presented in `initialization.configuration.data`.
        For example:
        [source]
        ----
        GET /vms?all_content=true&ovf_as_ova=true

        of the current request. See <<documents/003_common_concepts/follow, here>> for details.

        `headers`:: Additional HTTP headers.

        because the current quota may not be defined for the new storage domain.
        If this parameter is not used and the old quota is not defined for the new storage domain,
        the default (unlimited) quota will be assigned to the disk.

        `async_`:: Indicates if the move should be performed asynchronously.
