= oVirt Python SDK

== Introduction

The oVirt Python SDK is a Python package that simplyfies access to the
oVirt Engine API.

IMPORTANT: This document describes how to generate, build and test the
SDK. If you are interested in how to use it read the `README.adoc` file
in the `sdk` directory instead.

== Building

The SDK uses http://www.xmlsoft.org[libxml2] for parsing and rendering
XML documents, and the part that interacts with this library is written
in C. This means that before building you must make sure you have the C
compiler and the required header and libraries files installed in your
system. For example to install with the `yum` package manager you will
need to do the following:

  # yum -y install \
  gcc \
  libxml2-devel \
  python3-devel

Most of the source code of the Python SDK is automatically generated
from the API model.

The code generator is a Java program that resides in the `generator`
directory. This Java program will get the API model and the metamodel
artifacts from the available Maven repositories. Because of that in
order to build the Python SDK you need to install some additional
dependencies. For example to install with the `yum` package manager
you will need to do the following:

  # yum -y install \
  git \
  java-1.8.0-openjdk \
  maven \
  python3-flake8 \
  python3-nose \
  python3-wheel

To build and run the tests use the following commands:

  $ git clone git://gerrit.ovirt.org/ovirt-engine-sdk
  $ mvn package

To build without running the tests:

  $ mvn package -Dskipflake=true -DskipTests=true

This will build the code generator, run it to generate the SDK for the
version of the API that corresponds to the branch of the SDK that you
are using, and build the `.tar.gz` and `.whl` files.

If you need to generate it for a different version of the API then you
can use the `model.version` property. For example, if you need to
generate the SDK for version `4.1.0` of the SDK you can use this
command:

  $ mvn package -Dmodel.version=4.1.0

By default the build and the tests are executed using the `python` command.
If you wish to use a different version of Python you can use the
`python.command` property:

  $ mvn package -Dpython.command=python3

The generated `.tar.gz` and `.whl` files will be located in the
`sdk/dist` directory:

  $ find sdk/dist
  sdk/dist/ovirt-engine-sdk-4.0.0a0.linux-x86_64.tar.gz
  sdk/dist/ovirt-engine-sdk-4.0.0a0.tar.gz
  sdk/dist/ovirt_engine_sdk-4.0.0a0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl


== Release

To create a new release available on Maven Central one should provide a settings.xml file in the .m2 folder following the structure:
[source, xml]
-----
<settings>
    <servers>
        <server>
            <id>central</id>
            <username>${mvn_central_generated_username}</username>
            <password>${mvn_central_generated_pwd}</password>
        </server>
    </servers>
    <profiles>
        <profile>
            <id>central</id>
            <activation>
                <activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault>
            </activation>
            <properties>
                <gpg.executable>gpg2</gpg.executable>
                <gpg.passphrase>${gpg_passphrase}</gpg.passphrase>
            </properties>
        </profile>
    </profiles>
</settings>
----

After that all version tags need to be updated, that can be done using:

$ mvn release:prepare

NOTE: Snapshot versions do currently have a shelf life of 90 days on maven central.

To start generating your release and pushing it towards maven central run:

$ mvn deploy -Psign
