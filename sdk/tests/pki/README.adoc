= PKI Resources

This directory contains private key files and certificates used by the
tests:

ca.crt:: The certificate of the CA that is used to sign all the other
certificates.

localhost.key:: The private key of the `localhost` certificate.

localhost.crt:: The certificate for `localhost`.

ugly.key:: The private key of the `ugly` certificate.

ugly.crt:: The certificate for `ugly`.

The `ugly` private key and certificate are intended for tests that
check that connections to servers whose host name doesn't match the
certifcate common name fail.

All these certificates expire in 100 years, hopefully they will live
longer than the SDK.
