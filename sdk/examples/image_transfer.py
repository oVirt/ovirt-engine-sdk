Show how to start and stop image transfer, and keep the transfer alive.

imageio server will time out client connection after 60 seconds if the client
does not send any request. If you need to delay the transfer for some reason,
but want to keep the connection open, you can send some request to keep the
connection alive.

How to use this example
-----------------------

1. Create a new empty disk in engine

Find the disk uuid, assuming e2b9464e-6d9d-4f92-8375-2e5e087c5674 in this
example.

2. Run the image_transfer.py

$ ./image_transfer.py -c engine3 upload e2b9464e-6d9d-4f92-8375-2e5e087c5674
[   0.0 ] Connecting to engine...
[   0.0 ] Looking up disk e2b9464e-6d9d-4f92-8375-2e5e087c5674
[   0.3 ] Creating image transfer for upload
[   2.5 ] Transfer ID: da289f12-3513-467e-9da4-5e1a5d11c15f
[   2.5 ] Transfer host name: host4
[   2.5 ] Transfer URL: https://host4:54322/images/5916515f-d628-4311-8ce2-614c9d09731e
[   2.5 ] Proxy URL: https://engine3:54323/images/5916515f-d628-4311-8ce2-614c9d09731e
[   2.5 ] Conneted to imageio server

While the script is running, you can use Transfer URL or Proxy URL to access
imageio server.

$ curl -k https://host4:54322/images/5916515f-d628-4311-8ce2-614c9d09731e/extents | jq
[
  {
    "start": 0,
    "length": 6442450944,
    "zero": true,
    "hole": false
  }
]

You can also use imageio example client from imageio source:

$ git clone https://github.com/oVirt/ovirt-imageio.git
$ cd ovirt-imageio
$ make

$ examles/imageio-client upload \
    /var/tmp/fedora-32.img \
    https://host4:54322/images/5916515f-d628-4311-8ce2-614c9d09731e
[ 100.00% ] 6.00 GiB, 4.01 seconds, 1.50 GiB/s

$ curl -sk https://host4:54322/images/5916515f-d628-4311-8ce2-614c9d09731e/extents | jq
[
  {
    "start": 0,
    "length": 65536,
    "zero": false,
    "hole": false
  },
  {
    "start": 65536,
    "length": 983040,
    "zero": true,
    "hole": false
  },
...

To finalize the transfer, interrupt the script.

You can also cancel the transfer from engine UI, which will delete the disk
used by the image transfer.
